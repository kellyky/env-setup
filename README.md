I plan to use this repo as a space to initially note & save preferences & configurations I like for easier setup on a new machine. I may include copies of my .zshrc, .vimrc, .tmux.conf, etc. We'll see. Haven't decided yet whether to keep this public or private. There's nothing here _yet_ ðŸ˜‚

If I feel inspired, I may attempt to automate some of this... We'll see!
